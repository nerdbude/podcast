# Collection of files and code for a minimalistic podcast setting

### THINGS YOU NEED
- Audio content (I canÂ´t help you at this point you have to record episodes)
- A Webserver (get one and build a website)

### FEED
Every Podcast should have a feed. Itunes, Fyyd and other podcastplattforms need a feed to index your episodes.
The feed.xml in this folder is a template for a podcast-feed.
It is well commented with all required informations.
Just fill in your stuff and create a folder on your webserver and place the feed.xml within this folder.
