# How to start a Podcast

This repository is a collection of tutorials, code and other stuff to record and publish a Podcast.  

### Things you don't find here (but need for your podcast)
- An idea or a topic for your podcast
- webspace to host your podcast and the feed

### How to start
After you got a idea or topic for a podcast you should think about the name of the podcast.<br>
The name should be:<br>
* not to long
* easy to remember
* unique

Next step - get the domain for your podcast.<br>
This should contain the name of the podcast, so your potential listeners find it more easily.<br>

### Website

There are two options to publish your podcast.<br>
1. Selfhosting:
  I provide my podcast without any Wordpress or Plugin stuff. The whole feed and website is static and get changed with every new episode. A lot of extra work but it's worth it because you have the full control.

  In this repository is a simple template for a Blog / Website.<br>
  You have to change the default settings and upload the website to your webspace.<br>
  The website structure is based on my [NERDBUDE.COM](https://www.nerdbude.com) website structure and is a handmade blog.<br>
  There is nothing automated (at the moment) and you have to change the files for every new episode.<br>
  The template does not include the "Subscribe Button". You can get yours here: [PODLOVE SUBSCRIBE BUTTON](https://subscribe-button.podlove.org/#generator).<br>

  In this Repo is also a minimalistic Landingpage. Feel free to use it!

2. Wordpress:
  The more easy way to provide your new podcast. Install Wordpress and use the the Plugins [PODLOVE Podcast Publisher](https://www.podlove.org) and the [PODLOVE Subscribe Button](https://www.podlove.org).<br>
  These are tools from the podcast-community for the podcast-community.

### Cover
After you setup your website, domain and publishing system - you need a Podcast Cover.<br>
You can just make a main-cover or a main-cover and a episode-cover for every single Episode.<br>
The cover should expect the following specs:<br>

* 3000 x 3000 px
* 300dpi
* .jpg / .png fileformat

To create your cover you can use tools like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) or other tools or if you are not the kind of graphical artist check out the communities. Sometimes other podcasters offer to create a cover for you.<br>

### Pre-Recording
Before you start recording you need structure and a script.<br>
1. Structure:
  - do you have different sections on your podcast
  - do you want to talk about feedback (very recommended)
  - how often do you want to upload a new episode?
  - how long should your episode be?
  - will you make seasons or just episodes?
  - plan more than your first episode
  - think about a small trailer (~5min long)
  - (will be continued)

2. Script:
  - make notes for every episode
  - for interviews - write down the questions
  - split the script in the sections of your podcast

### Hardware
Many people say you can start a podcast with your smartphone and a headset - that is right. Some years ago I started my first Podacst with just the microphone of a MacBook Pro and it worked, well "ok"<br>
If you want to record in a more professionel way there are two pieces of hardware I can totally recommend:<br>
* Superlux HMC660x Headset (€50,-) [LINK](https://www.thomann.de/de/superlux_hmc_660_x.htm)
* Behringer Xenyx 302 USB Interface (€44,-) [LINK](https://www.thomann.de/de/behringer_xenyx_302_usb.htm)

Both are not that expensiv but bring a great sound with it.

### Software
So you have a script and the hardware. Now you need the recordingsoftware.<br>
There are a lot of free and paid software sollutions to record your stuff.

* Audacity (free) [LINK](https://www.audacity.de)
* Ardour (free) [LINK](https://www.ardour.org)
* Reaper ($60) [LINK](https://www.reaper.fm)

Reaper may cost something but there is a nice Community-Project called ["Ultraschall"](https://www.ultraschall.fm) as a pure Podcast-Plugin for Reaper.<br>
Play around which recording-software you are most comfortable with.

### Feed
After you record and cut your first episode - it's time to release it.<br>
Your feed give the new episodes to the players from your listeners.<br>

If you want to build your own feed feel free to use the template in this repository.<br>
It is well commented and you just need to fill it with all your stuff.<br>
After you fill in the informations just put it in a folder in your webspace.<br>
Later this folder is the adress for the podcast-directories.<br>

### Release
After you upload your soundfile and your feed.xml to your webspace it's time to tell the internet that you have a podcast now.<br>
There are three importent Podcast-Directories to start with:<br>
* [FYYD](https://www.fyyd.de)
* [APPLE](https://itunesconnect.apple.com)
* [GOOGLE](https://podcastmanager.google.com)

On these Platforms you just have to paste your feed-url and after a short review your podcast will be available in nearly every directory.

### Share

Congratulations! Your Podcast is ready. Now you have to say the people that you have a podcast.
